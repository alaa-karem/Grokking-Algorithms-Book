# Dynamic-Programming
---
### dyanmic programming:
##### starts by solving subproblems and builds up to solving the big problems
---
### Every dynamic-programming algorithm starts with a grid
---
### Dynamic programming is useful when you’re trying to optimize something given a constraint.
---
### You can use dynamic programming when the problem can be broken into discrete subproblems, and they don’t depend on each other.
