# Hash-Tables
### Hash function:
##### is a function where you put in a string and you get back a number as we can say that a hash function maps different string to different numbers

---

* #### Input: 
  * string
* #### Output:
  * index
* #### Answer:
  * map[index]

### Hash table:
##### Most useful complex data structure

---

### Caching is a common way to make things faster. All big websites use caching, and that data is cached in a hash!

---

### Collision:
##### two keys have been assigned the same slot. 
###### Collisions are bad, and you need to work around them. There are many different ways to deal with collisions. 
###### The simplest one is this: if multiple keys map to the same slot, start a linked list at that slot.

### Load-Factor:
* ##### Load factor measures how many empty slots remain in your hash table. 
* ##### Number of items in hash table / total number of slots
* ##### With a lower load factor, youâ€™ll have fewer collisions
